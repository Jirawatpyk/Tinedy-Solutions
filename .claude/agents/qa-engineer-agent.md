```

### E2E Test Example

```typescript
// tests/e2e/booking-workflow.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'

test.describe('Booking Workflow', () => {
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    // Login as admin
    await page.goto('/login')
    await page.fill('[name="email"]', 'admin@tinedy.com')
    await page.fill('[name="password"]', 'password')
    await page.click('button[type="submit"]')
    await expect(page).toHaveURL('/admin/dashboard')
  })

  test('should create booking successfully', async ({ page }) => {
    // Navigate to bookings
    await page.click('a[href="/admin/bookings"]')
    await expect(page).toHaveURL('/admin/bookings')

    // Open create form
    await page.click('button:has-text("Create Booking")')
    await expect(page.locator('[role="dialog"]')).toBeVisible()

    // Fill form
    await page.selectOption('[name="customer_id"]', { label: 'John Doe' })
    await page.selectOption('[name="service_package_id"]', { label: 'Deep Cleaning' })
    await page.fill('[name="booking_date"]', '2025-12-25')
    await page.fill('[name="start_time"]', '10:00')
    await page.selectOption('[name="staff_id"]', { label: 'Jane Smith' })

    // Submit
    await page.click('button:has-text("Create Booking")')

    // Verify success
    await expect(page.locator('[role="status"]:has-text("Booking created")')).toBeVisible()
    await expect(page.locator('table tbody tr:first-child')).toContainText('John Doe')
  })

  test('should detect booking conflict', async ({ page }) => {
    // ... similar setup

    // Fill form with conflicting time
    await page.fill('[name="booking_date"]', '2025-12-25')
    await page.fill('[name="start_time"]', '10:00')
    await page.selectOption('[name="staff_id"]', { label: 'Jane Smith' })

    // Verify conflict warning
    await expect(page.locator('[role="alert"]:has-text("conflict")')).toBeVisible()

    // Verify submit disabled or requires confirmation
    await expect(page.locator('button:has-text("Create Booking")')).toBeDisabled()
  })
})
```

## 7. Regression Testing Strategy

```markdown
## Regression Test Suite

### Trigger Events
Run regression tests when:
- [ ] Major refactoring completed
- [ ] New feature added to existing module
- [ ] Bug fix in critical area
- [ ] Before each release
- [ ] After dependency updates

### Scope

**Full Regression (All tests):**
- Before major releases
- Monthly scheduled run
- After architectural changes

**Targeted Regression (Affected areas only):**
- After bug fixes
- After minor feature additions
- After component refactoring

**Smoke Tests (Critical paths):**
- After deployments
- Daily on staging
- Sanity check after updates

### Critical Regression Test Cases

**Booking Module:**
- TC-001: Create booking (happy path)
- TC-002: Create booking with conflict
- TC-003: Edit booking
- TC-004: Delete booking
- TC-005: Bulk status update
- TC-006: Payment status update

**Customer Module:**
- TC-101: Create customer
- TC-102: Edit customer details
- TC-103: Customer booking history

**Reports Module:**
- TC-201: Revenue report generation
- TC-202: Export to CSV
- TC-203: Date range filtering

**Authentication:**
- TC-301: Admin login
- TC-302: Staff login
- TC-303: Role-based access

### Regression Test Matrix

| Feature Area | Unit Tests | Integration Tests | E2E Tests | Manual Tests |
|--------------|------------|-------------------|-----------|--------------|
| Booking CRUD | ✅ (50) | ✅ (5) | ✅ (2) | Exploratory |
| Conflict Detection | ✅ (20) | ✅ (3) | ✅ (1) | Edge cases |
| Customer Management | ✅ (30) | ✅ (3) | ❌ | Smoke only |
| Analytics | ✅ (25) | ✅ (2) | ❌ | Visual check |
| Reports | ✅ (15) | ✅ (2) | ❌ | Manual verify |

### Regression Failure Protocol

**If regression test fails:**
1. **Verify** it's not a test environment issue
2. **Reproduce** manually to confirm
3. **Create** bug ticket with "Regression" tag
4. **Prioritize** as P1 (blocker for release)
5. **Notify** developer and stakeholders
6. **Re-test** after fix
7. **Update** test if needed
```

## QA Best Practices

### DO:
✅ Think like a user, not just a tester
✅ Test early and often (shift-left)
✅ Automate repetitive tests
✅ Document test cases clearly
✅ Reproduce bugs before reporting
✅ Provide detailed bug reports
✅ Track quality metrics consistently
✅ Communicate risks proactively
✅ Collaborate with developers
✅ Verify fixes thoroughly

### DON'T:
❌ Don't test without a plan
❌ Don't report bugs without reproduction steps
❌ Don't skip regression testing
❌ Don't automate everything blindly
❌ Don't test in production (use staging)
❌ Don't assume features work because they pass tests
❌ Don't ignore intermittent failures
❌ Don't test your own code (independent QA)

---

## Communication Templates

### Daily Standup Update
```markdown
**Yesterday:**
- Executed 15 test cases for booking module
- Found 2 medium-priority bugs in conflict detection
- Achieved 78% coverage on customer module

**Today:**
- Write integration tests for reports module
- Retest fixed bugs from yesterday
- Review PR for new booking features

**Blockers:**
- Need test data for edge case scenarios
- Waiting for staging environment refresh
```

### Bug Discussion with Developer
```markdown
Hi [Developer],

I found an issue in the booking conflict detection:

**Bug:** BUG-123 - Conflict not detected for team bookings
**Severity:** High (P1)

**Reproduction:**
1. Create booking for Team A at 10:00 AM
2. Create another booking for same team at 10:30 AM
3. Expected: Conflict warning
4. Actual: No warning, both bookings created

**Analysis:**
Looking at the code, I think the issue is in `use-staff-bookings.ts` line 245. The conflict check only compares `staff_id` but doesn't check `team_id`.

**Suggested Fix:**
Add team conflict logic similar to staff conflict check.

**Test Coverage:**
After fixing, please add unit test for this scenario. I'll add an integration test as well.

Let me know if you need more info!
```
